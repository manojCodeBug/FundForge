## Production MVP

FundForge is a production-ready Level 4 MVP featuring live testnet deployment, a mobile-responsive frontend architecture, and full telemetry capabilities.

* **Live Deployment URL**: [https://fund-forge.netlify.app/](https://fund-forge.netlify.app/)
* **Production Architecture**: Designed around a factory pattern where a central registry contract dynamically deploys self-contained smart escrow contracts on the Stellar Testnet.
* **Real User Onboarding**: Supported by an interactive step-by-step onboarding walkthrough that leads new users from wallet creation through campaign backing.
* **Real Wallet Interactions**: Integrates Freighter and Albedo wallets using the Stellar Wallets Kit, signing and submitting actual testnet transactions.
* **Telemetry Integrations**: Features a custom local-state, console-logged, and API-dispatchable analytics framework alongside error tracking services.
* **Feedback Pipeline**: Synchronizes live feedback surveys via Google Forms directly to public spreadsheets.

## Problem Statement

Traditional crowdfunding platforms suffer from:
1. **High Fee Structures**: Middlemen charge 5-10% of total raised funds.
2. **Centralized Discretion**: Platforms can unilaterally freeze accounts, block campaigns, or delay payouts.
3. **Lack of settlement transparency**: Contributors have no cryptographic guarantee that their funds are allocated or refunded correctly.
4. **Siloed Systems**: High friction for cross-border contributions due to complex banking relationships.

## Solution

FundForge resolves these challenges by executing campaign structures directly on-chain using Soroban Smart Contracts:
1. **Negligible Transaction Fees**: Average transaction fees are fractions of a cent on the Stellar network.
2. **Decentralized Escrows**: Funds are locked inside trustless escrow contracts with automated goal-evaluation logic.
3. **Automated Settlements**: Payouts are triggered immediately upon goal completion, and refunds are instantly accessible to contributors if a campaign fails to hit its target.
4. **Global & Borderless**: Open to anyone in the world with a Stellar wallet.

## Why Stellar

Stellar provides the optimal foundation for crowdfunding:
- **Fast Settlements**: 5-second ledger times guarantee instant receipt of contributions and settlement transactions.
- **Soroban Smart Contracts**: Rust-based WASM virtual machine offers high-performance execution, predictable fees, and memory safety.
- **Native Wallet Ecosystem**: Robust wallet integrations (Freighter, Albedo) allow users to seamlessly manage, sign, and authorize transactions.

---

## Features

- **Wallet Integration**: Native connection to Stellar extension wallets.
- **Multi-Wallet Support**: Seamless sign-in and signing via Freighter and Albedo.
- **Campaign Creation**: Dynamic deployment of dedicated escrow contracts directly via a factory registry.
- **Donations**: Real-time contributions directly to on-chain escrow pools.
- **Event Streaming**: Horizon-based Server-Sent Events (SSE) stream activity in real-time, eliminating HTTP polling.
- **Transaction Center**: Tracking system for transaction state transitions (processing, confirmed, failed).
- **Analytics**: Recharts telemetry panel displaying network usage, transaction frequency, and contributions volume.
- **Settings**: Advanced developer control dashboard to configure RPC node endpoints, Horizon urls, and toggle visual modes.
- **Smart Contract Upgrades**: Admin-controlled and Creator-controlled bytecode upgrade paths using Soroban update-wasm.

## Smart Contract Design

### Campaign Registry Contract
The registry contract acts as a central campaign directory and deployment factory.
- **Factory Deployer**: Deploys new instances of the `funding-escrow` contract dynamically using salt values.
- **Admin Configuration**: Restricts initialization and wasm upgrade procedures to authorized admins.
- **Metadata Management**: Tracks all deployed campaign details, addresses, and states in contract instance storage.

### Funding Escrow Contract
Each crowdfunding campaign has a dedicated, self-contained escrow contract.
- **Fund Lock**: Securely stores contributors' tokens on-chain until the target is met or deadline passes.
- **Claim Operations**: Releases campaign tokens to the creator *only* if the total raised >= funding goal.
- **Refund Operations**: Reverts contributions to original sponsors if the campaign fails.
- **Upgradeability**: Allows the campaign creator to perform authorized bytecode upgrades.

## Security Considerations

1. **Access Control**: Critical functions (initialization, upgrades, contract deployment, claims) utilize `require_auth()` to prevent unauthorized interventions.
2. **Bytecode Upgradeability**: Smart contracts can only be upgraded by their designated, authorized owners (`Admin` for registry, `Creator` for escrow).
3. **Double-Initialization Protection**: Instance state checks block re-entry attacks and initialization overrides.
4. **Goal and Deadline Validation**: Enforces positive targets and future ledger deadlines.

---

## Analytics & Monitoring

FundForge's telemetry engine tracks user engagement metrics directly within the frontend:
* **Wallet Connections**: Logs the wallet type and address to analyze initial entry.
* **Campaign Views**: Tracks visits to individual campaign detail pages.
* **Campaign Creation**: Logs details of newly deployed escrow contracts.
* **Donations**: Records the quantity and time of XLM transfer events.
* **Transaction Tracking**: Monitors on-chain execution states (Initiated, Success, Failed).
* **Event Streaming Metrics**: Inspects real-time events sent via Horizon SSE channels.

Analytics are used to evaluate user engagement rates and measure platform adoption.

---

## Monitoring

FundForge relies on a dedicated health monitoring layer (`src/services/monitoring.ts`) to track exceptions and maintain platform reliability:
* **Error Tracking**: Global React component capture (ErrorBoundary integration).
* **Transaction Failures**: Captured when signature authorization fails or gas limits are hit.
* **Wallet Errors**: Identifies missing extensions or network mismatches.
* **RPC Errors**: Alerts devs to latency spikes or downtime in Horizon nodes.
* **Performance Monitoring**: Tracks the API request latency and UI rendering cycles.

---

## User Onboarding

FundForge features a step-by-step interactive walk-through modal that guides new users through the platform:
1. **Connect Wallet**: Guides users to install Freighter/Albedo and establish a testnet account.
2. **Explore Campaigns**: Prompts users to inspect existing crowdfunding escrows.
3. **Create Campaign**: Demonstrates the factory deployment process.
4. **Donate to Campaign**: Illustrates the deposit locking and refund guarantees.
5. **Review Analytics**: Directs users to the performance dashboard.
